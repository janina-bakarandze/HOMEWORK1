        <h1>Web Development</h1>
        <p><b>Web development</b> is the work involved in developing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website" title="A website is any webpage whose content is identified by a common domain name and is published on ar least one web server."> website </a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" title=" The internet is global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the internet protocoll suite (TCP/IP) to communicate bewteen networks and devices. "> Internet </a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" ></a> or an <a href="#">intranet</a> <a href="#"> (World Wide Web) </a><a href="#"><sup><small>[1]</small></sup></a>
        <br> Web development can range from developing a simple single <a href="#">static page</a> of <a href="#">plain text</a> to complex <a href="#">web applications, <br> electronic businesses,</a> and <a href="#"> social network services.</a> A more comprehensive list of tasks to  which Web development commonly
        <br> refers, may include <a href="#">Web engineering, Web design, Web contens development</a> client liaison <a href="#">client-side/server-side scripting 
        <br> Web server </a> and <a href="#">network security configuration, and <a href="#">e-commerce</a> development.</a>
        </p>
        <p>Among Web Professionals, ''Web development'' usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing 
        <br> <a href="#">markup</a> and <a href="#">coding. <sup><small>[2]</small></sup> </a> Web development may use <a href="#">content management systems (CMS)</a> to make content changes easier and 
        <br> available with basic technical skills 
        </p>
        <p>
            For larger organization and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people <a href="#">(Web developers)</a> 
            <br> and follow standart methods like <a href="#">Agile methodologies</a> while developing Web sites. <a href="#"><sup><small>[1]</small></sup></a>. Smaller organization may only requre a single 
            <br>permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a <a href="#">graphic designer</a> or <a href="#">information 
            <br> system</a> technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a 
            <br> designated department. There are three kinds of Wen developer specialization : <a href="#">front-end developer</a>, back-end developer, and 
            <br> full stack developer. <a href="#"><sup><small>[3]</small></sup></a>. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visual that run in the user browser, while back-
            <br>end developers deal with the servers. <a href="#"><sup><small>[4]</small></sup></a> Since the commercialization on Web, the industry has boomed and has become one
            <br>of the most used technologies ever.

        <h3>Origin/Web 1.0</h3>
        <p><a href="#">Tim Berners-Lee</a> created the <a href="#">World Wide Web</a>in 1989 at CERN <a href="#"><sup><small>[5]</small></sup></a></p>
        <p>The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated information-sharing needs of academics addiliated
            <br>with institutions and various global organizations. Consequiently, <a href="#">HTML</a> was developed in 1993 <a href="#"> <sup><small>[6]</small></sup></a></p>
        <p> Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view material and provide a small amount of information <a href="#"><sup><small>[7]</small></sup></a>
        <br>Core protocols of web 1.0 were <a href="#">HTTP</a>, HTML and <a href="#">URI</a>. <a href="#"><sup><small>[8]</small></sup></a>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Web 2.0</h3>
        <p><a href="#">Web 2.0</a> a term popularised by <a href="#">Dale Dougherty</a>, then vice president of O'Reilly, during a 2004 conference with Media Live,
            <br> marks a shift in internet usage, emphasizing interactivity. <a href="#"><sup><small>[9]</small></sup></a><a href="#"><sup><small>[10]</small></sup></a> </p>
            <p>Web 2.0 introduced increased user engagement and communication. it evolved from the static, read-only nature of Web 1.0 Attending
              <br>became and integrated network for engagement and communication. It is often reffered to as a user-focused, read-write online
              <br> network <a href="#"><sup><small>[7]</small></sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the realm of Web 2.0 environments, users now have access to a platform that encourages sharing activities such as creating
                <br>music, files, images, and movies. <a href="#"><sup>[11]</sup></a> The architecture of Web 2.0 os often considered the ''backbone of the internet'' using 
                <br>standardized <a href="#">XML</a> (Extensible Markup Language) tags to authorize infromation flow from independent platforms and <a href="#">online databases</a>. <a href="#"><sup><small>[7]</small></sup></a>

    <div>
        <h3>Web 3.0</h3>
        <P>Web 3.0 considereed the rhirs and current version of the web, was introduced in 2014. the concept envisions a complate 
            <br>redisign of the web. key features include the integration of <a href="#">metadata</a>, precise information delivery, and improved <a href="#">user 
                <br> experiences</a>based on preferences, history, and interests. <a href="#"><sup><i>[citation needed]</i></sup></a></P>
        <p>
            Web 3.0 aims to turn the web into a sizable, organized database, providing more functionalityt that traditional search enginges.
            <br>Users can customize navigation based on their preferences, and the core ideas involve identifying data sources, connecting 
            <br> them for efficiency, and creating user profiles. <a href="#"><sup><small>[7]</small></sup></a>
            <p>This version is sometimes also known as <a href="#">Semantic Web</a>. <a href="#"><sup><small>[12]</small></sup></a></p>

        <h3>Evolution of web development technologies</h3>
        <p>The journey of web development dechnologies began with simple <a href="#">HTML</a> pages in the early days of the internet. Over time,
           <br> advancements led  to incorporation of <a href="#">CSS</a> for styling and <a href="#">JavaScript</a> for interactivity. This evolution transformed static 
           <br>websited into dynamic and responsive platforms, setting the stage for the complex and feature-rich web applications we have 
           <br>today.
